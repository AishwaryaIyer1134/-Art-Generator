# 🎨 GAN-Based Art Generator
### ✨ AI Art Creation with Stable Diffusion ✨

An **AI-powered art generator** built using a **pre-trained Stable Diffusion pipeline**, inspired by **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) concepts**, capable of producing high-quality and visually compelling artwork from text prompts.

## 🌟 Overview

This project demonstrates how **modern diffusion-based generative models** can be leveraged to generate creative artwork without training models from scratch. By using a **pre-trained Stable Diffusion model**, the generator efficiently converts latent noise into meaningful and artistic images.

This repository is ideal for learning, experimentation, and showcasing **Generative AI** and **AI-driven art creation**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Pre-trained **Stable Diffusion** model
- 🧠 GAN-inspired generative workflow
- 🖼️ High-resolution AI-generated images
- ✍️ Text-to-image generation
- ⚡ GPU acceleration support
- 🔧 Customizable prompts and parameters

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **PyTorch**
- **Stable Diffusion**
- **Hugging Face Diffusers**
- **NumPy**
- **CUDA**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Loads a pre-trained **Stable Diffusion pipeline**
2. Initializes latent noise
3. Iteratively denoises using diffusion steps
4. Applies GAN-inspired principles for realism
5. Generates a final high-quality image based on the prompt
